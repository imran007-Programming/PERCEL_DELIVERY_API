# Parcel Delivery System API

Welcome to the **Parcel Delivery System API**, a robust and secure backend service designed to manage parcel shipments efficiently. This API supports user management, parcel creation, tracking, delivery status updates, and role-based access control to streamline the entire delivery process.

Built with **TypeScript**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, the system ensures data validation, authentication, and authorization for different user roles including Admin, Sender, Receiver, and Delivery Agent.

This documentation covers the available API endpoints, their usage, and the role-based permissions necessary to interact with each route.

## üîÑ Status Tracking Structure

Each parcel maintains an array of status logs:

```json
"trackingEvents": [
{
  "status": "PENDING",
  "location": "Farmgate, Dhaka",
  "note": "Parcel created",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-01T16:35:39.427Z"
},
{
  "status": "PICKED",
  "location": "Dhaka Hub",
  "note": "Parcel arrived at sorting facility",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-02T10:00:00.000Z"
}
]
